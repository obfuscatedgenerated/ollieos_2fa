# OllieOS 2FA

`pkg add 2fa`

A TOTP code generator for OllieOS.

The only supported subcommand currently is `2fa now`.

You really shouldn't use this for anything serious :P

> Note: this is yet to be updated to the modern ollieos#types build approach. If you're looking for better example pakcages, use the [template package](https://github.com/obfuscatedgenerated/ollieos_test_pkg).
